# Color Sorter

## Components Required
* [`Arduino Uno`](https://techshopbd.com/detail?product_id=3218)
* [`TCS3200 Color Sensor`](https://techshopbd.com/detail?product_id=1508)
* [`Servo Motor`](https://techshopbd.com/detail?product_id=659)
* `Switch`
* `Power Jack`
* `Breadboard and Jumper Wires`

## Description 
* The Color sorting machine is fully automated with the help of Arduino Uno. The overall electrical system is based on the color sensor, which is connected to the servo motor. <br>
The color sensor and the servo are connected to an Arduino single board microcontroller, which is the central logic of the system. <br>
The TCS3200 is a color light-to-frequency converter, which provides square waves with frequency output proportional directly to the light intensity. <br>
Each color is represented by the photodiode filters that are connected in parallel.


## Steps 
* <b>Initially, the colored items are dropped into the platform attached on the top servo motor. </b>
* <b>Then the servo motor rotates and brings the item to the color sensor which detects its color. </b>
* <b>After that the bottom servo motor rotates to the particular position and then the top servo motor rotates again till the item drops into the guide rail.</b>
